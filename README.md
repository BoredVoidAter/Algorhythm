Welcome to Algorhythm! This is the home for a new kind of social discovery platform where code is the main event. Scroll through an endless feed of creativity and brilliance from the developer community.

## 🧐 What is this?

**Algorhythm** is a social discovery platform designed to feel like TikTok, but for developers. Forget endless text-based forums and dense articles. Here, you discover and share captivating code snippets through an infinite, vertical feed.

Whether it's an **elegant sorting algorithm**, a **clever UI trick in CSS**, or a **beautiful data visualization in Python**, Algorhythm brings it to you in a visually engaging and easily digestible format. Our mission is to make learning, sharing, and discovering code a fun, addictive, and community-driven experience.

## ✨ Features

We've packed Algorhythm with features designed for discovery and engagement.

*   **Core Snippet Feed and Rendering:**
    *   **Infinite Vertical Feed:** Our core experience. Scroll endlessly through a stream of code snippets curated just for you. The next "aha!" moment is just a swipe away.
    *   **Interactive Syntax Highlighting:** Beautiful, multi-language support makes your code readable and professional. Each snippet is rendered in a distinct card with its associated user-provided description.

*   **User Authentication and Profiles:**
    *   **Secure Registration & Login:** Users can register and log in with email and password.
    *   **Basic User Profiles:** Upon registration, a basic user profile is created to associate users with the content they post.

*   **Snippet Creation and Posting:**
    *   **Intuitive Snippet Form:** Authenticated users can easily post new snippets.
    *   **Code, Title, and Language Selection:** The form includes a text area for the code, a field for a title or explanation, and a way to select the code's programming language to ensure correct syntax highlighting.

*   **Snippet Engagement and Bookmarking:**
    *   **Like Snippets:** Show appreciation for snippets by liking them. The total like count is publicly visible.
    *   **Bookmark Snippets:** Save snippets to a private collection for later reference.

*   **Commenting on Snippets:**
    *   **Collaborative Comments:** Authenticated users can post comments below each snippet to ask questions, offer feedback, or discuss implementations.

*   **Content Tagging and Discovery:**
    *   **Tagging System:** Creators can add relevant keywords (e.g., `#javascript`, `#animation`) to their snippets.
    *   **Filter by Tags:** Users can click on tags to filter the feed and discover snippets with specific tags.

*   **🚀 Viral Engagement:** We're built for community interaction.
    *   **Interactive Snippet Previews**: Engage with front-end code snippets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) directly within the feed through live, sandboxed previews for UI components, animations, and data visualizations.
    *   **User-Curated Collections**: Create and manage public 'Collections' of related snippets from various creators (e.g., 'Advanced React Patterns', 'CSS Animation Tricks'), which can be shared and followed by others.
    *   **Real-time Notification Center**: Stay updated with a dedicated notification panel for likes, new comments, replies, new followers, and code forks.
    *   **Coding Challenges:** Participate in weekly challenges to test your skills and see how others tackle the same problem.
    *   **Community Forks:** See a snippet you can improve or want to experiment with? "Fork" it, add your spin, and share it with the community.
    *   **Personalized Recommendations:** Our custom algorithm learns what you love—be it JavaScript animations, Python data science, or Rust performance hacks—and personalizes your feed.

## 🛠️ For the Hobbyist Developer: The Tech & The Challenges

Algorhythm is more than just a platform; it's a playground for developers who love a good technical challenge. If you're looking to sink your teeth into a meaningful project, this is the place. We are tackling some exciting problems:

*   **⚡ Performant Virtualized Scroll:** Building an infinite scroll that can handle thousands of complex, syntax-highlighted code blocks without dropping a frame is a major challenge. We need a buttery-smooth experience on any device.

*   **🧠 Custom Recommendation Algorithm:** Moving beyond simple "likes," we're building a recommendation engine from the ground up that understands code context, user skills, and community trends to deliver a truly personalized feed.

*   **🔒 Secure Code Rendering Engine:** Executing or rendering user-submitted code (especially for visualizations) requires a secure, sandboxed environment. We're designing a multi-language engine that is both powerful and safe.
